      <h1 class="text-center featured-text">The story of Jerry Gillespie</h1>
      <p>After Jerry proclaimed his innocence, Chicago detectives slapped Jerry in the face, grabbed him by the throat, and knocked him to the ground while he was handcuffed to a chair until he falsely confessed to a crime he did not commit.</p>

      <p>Even after the two actual murderers wrote out and signed sworn affidavits over ten years later admitting their crimes and corroborating Jerry’s claim that he had nothing to do with the murder, procedural technicalities prevented Jerry from seeking exoneration.</p>

      <p>The Chicago Police Department failed Jerry. The legal system failed Jerry.  Now is the time to bring Jerry the justice he needs.</p>
