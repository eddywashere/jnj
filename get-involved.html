    <p>Jerry Gillespie, his mother, Maxine Franklin, and his attorney, Andrea Lyon, have gone through every avenue of the legal system seeking justice. Their pleas for relief have continually been denied without as much as a hearing. However, you can still help Jerry by signing his petition and sharing his story with others. It's time for Jerry's story to be heard. It's time for justice.</p>
